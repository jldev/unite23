# UNITE 2023 - STEM Robotics with AI Machine Vision @ Jackson State University


This is the reposistory used for the STEM Robotics with AI Computer Vision workshop taught at Jackson State University during [UNITE 2023](https://www.usaeop.com/program/unite/)

## Workshop Goal

**Students leave with an undestanding of basic motion control and how computer vision allows robots to "see".**



Introduce students to robotics with basic motion control using Arudino [Adeept AWR-4](https://www.adeept.com/awr-a_p0132.html).

Use computer vision to navigate and make decisions using a [HuskyLens](https://www.dfrobot.com/huskylens.html).

The workshop is 4-5 days roughly 3 hours each day.  The rough plan is below

### Day 1
- Instructor and Student Introductions
- Introduction to Robotics and Computer Vision
    - Slideshow and videos - students discuss what robots they are aware of and how they think they work
    - Computer vision examples - object detection, object tracking, segmentation, etc
- Arduino IDE Setup
- Introduction to Adeept Robot
- Get robot to move - no pressure here just any motion - proves the computers are setup and the students can load code on the robots

### Day 2
- Introduction and plan for the day - robot programmed to do basic motion (square)
- First half - Program robot to make a square
- Second half - Introduce HuskyLens
    - show how the HuskyLens can be trained on objects, follow line, etc

### Day 3
- Introduction and plan for the day - use HuskyLens to track an object
- Program HuskyLens to track an object
- Use HuskyLens tracking information to navigate with robot

### Day 4
- Introduction and plan for the day - carry over from Day 3 - follow the line with HuskeyLens

### Day 5
- Introduction and plan for the day - carry over from Day 4 - control robot with tags




# HuskyLens Library Install
Copy the HUSKYLENS folder from libraries/HUSKKEYLENSArduino-master to the library folder for Arduino, For me on Windows it is located at C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Arduino15\libraries
